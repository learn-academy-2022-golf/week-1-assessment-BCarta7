# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a tool on my computer that can track changes you make to files. GitHub is a server service that can link with Git, letting you save the changes in an online repository you can share with others.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system on your pc allowing you to manage track source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based service allowing you to manage Git repositories.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: I am honestly not sure on the terminology of this question, but would be happy to research it and get back to you. I know Boolean values can be used in conditionals to guide the logic.

Researched answer: logical operators, including && (AND), || (OR), and \ (NOT), return true or false (boolean) by comparing values.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: an index is the numeric location of an item in an array, with the first item starting at 0. I think the value is the actual data of each item in the array.

Researched answer: an index in javascript numerically indicates the location of an element in an array starting from 0. A value is the actual data type and content of each individual element.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Strings and arrays are both indexed, and can hold a number of values. Strings return only characters, while arrays can hold numbers and other data types. 

Researched answer: An array is a collection of indexed elements of the same data type, a string is a set of characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The driver is responsible for typing and entering the code being narrated. The navigator is responsible for narrating the code and syntax to the driver while checking for typing errors. 

Researched answer: pair programming involves two programmers working together on the same machine. The driver writes the code, while the navigator reviews the code as it is being entered.
